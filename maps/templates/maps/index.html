Otherwise, ignore these coordiantes as they will not be useful to you.</small></h6></li>
                <li><h6><small>At your leisure, type any building names, addresses, or coordinates you so desire into the search bars, and so long as there is a start and end destination, a route will appear on the map taking you where you want to go.</small></h6></li>
                <li><h6><small>You should be able to move the map around and zoom in/out at your convenicne. <strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Should you be trying to drag the map around and it doesn't appear to be moving, BEFORE realeasing the mouse, drag it off to the side away from the map! If you don't, the map may accidentally change your route.</small></h6></li>
                <li><h6><small>Just below the map, you can find your current location coordinates (<strong>should your "Location Services" be turned on</strong>). Also, a simple refresh of the page will put your current location back in the top search bar.</small></h6></li>

                <li><h6><small>You will have to name any route you save. We recommend you think of a clever name before saving any route so that it will be easy for you to determine what each saved route corresponds to.</small></h6></li>
